# Layers
Total points: 67

## Introduction

In this chapter, you'll expand on your `ggplot2` foundation as you learn about the layered grammar of graphics. We'll start with a deeper dive into aesthetic mappings, geometric objects, and facets. Then, you will learn about statistical transformations `ggplot2` makes under the hood when creating a plot. These transformations are used to calculate new values to plot, such as the heights of bars in a bar plot or medians in a box plot. You will also learn about  position adjustments, which modify how `geoms` are displayed in your plots.

We will not cover every single function and option for each of these layers, but we will walk you through the most important and commonly used functionality provided by `ggplot2` as well as introduce you to packages that extend `ggplot2`.

### Prerequisites

To access the datasets, help pages, and functions used in this chapter, first install the packages `patchwork`, `ggridges` and `scales` if you haven't already by uncommenting this code:

```{r}

# install.packages(c("patchwork","ggridges","scales"))

```

Then load the necessary packages into your session:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
```


## Aesthetic mappings

The `mpg` data frame is bundled with the ggplot2 package and contains
`r nrow(mpg)` observations on `r mpg %>% distinct(model) %>% nrow()` car
models from [fueleconomy.gov](https://fueleconomy.gov/). 

```{r include = F}

?mpg

names(mpg)

```

Among the variables in `mpg` are:

1. `displ`: A car's engine size, in liters. A numerical variable.

2. `hwy`: A car's fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon
    (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a
    car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.
    A numerical variable.

3. `class`: Type of car. A categorical variable.

Let's start by visualizing the relationship between `displ` and `hwy`
for various `classes` of cars. We can do this with a scatterplot where
the numerical variables are mapped to the `x` and `y` aesthetics and the
categorical variable is mapped to an aesthetic like `color` or `shape`

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.asp = 0.4, fig.show = 'hold'}
library(patchwork)
(ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point()) +
(ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) + 
  geom_point()) + 
  plot_layout(ncol = 2)
```

Note the use of `plot_layout` from the `patchwork` package to layout the plots in two rows.

`patchwork` also allows use of mathematical symbols to layout `ggplots`:

Use `+` to plot them side-by-side:

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.asp = 0.4}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + 
  ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) + geom_point() 
```

Use '/' to plot them in one column:

```{r fig.height = 10, fig.width = 7, out.width = "100%"}

(ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point())/ 
  (ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) + geom_point())
```

Notice that parentheses are required for this operation unless you first save the plots:

```{r fig.height = 10}

p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point()

p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class)) + geom_point()

p1/p2

```

When `class` is mapped to `shape`, we get two warnings:

> 1: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because more than 6 becomes difficult to discriminate; you have 7.
> Consider specifying shapes manually if you must have them.
>
> 2: Removed 62 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).

Since `ggplot2` will only use six shapes at a time, by default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic.
The second warning is related -- there are 62 SUVs in the dataset and they're not plotted.

Similarly, we can map `class` to `size` or `alpha` aesthetics as well, which control the size and the transparency of the points, respectively.

```{r fig.width = 5}

# class mapped to size
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class)) +
  geom_point() 

# class mapped to alpha
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class)) +
  geom_point() 
```

Both of these produce warnings as well:

> Using size for a discrete variable is not advised.
> Using alpha for a discrete variable is not advised.

Mapping an unordered discrete (categorical) variable (`class`) to an ordered aesthetic (`size` or `alpha`) is generally not a good idea because it implies a ranking that does not in fact exist.

Once you map an aesthetic, `ggplot2` takes care of the rest. It selects a reasonable **scale** to use with the aesthetic, and it constructs a **legend** that explains the mapping between levels and values. For x and y aesthetics, `ggplot2` does not create a legend, but it creates an axis line with tick marks and a label. The axis line provides the same information as a legend; it explains the mapping between locations and values.

You can also set the visual properties of your `geom` manually as an argument of your `geom` function (*outside* of `aes()`) instead of relying on a variable mapping to determine the appearance. For example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue:

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue") 
```

Here, the **color** doesn't convey information about a variable, but only changes the appearance of the plot.
You'll need to pick a value that makes sense for that aesthetic:

-   The name of a color as a character string, e.g., `color = "blue"`
-   The size of a point in mm, e.g., `size = 1`
-   The shape of a point as a number, e.g, `shape = 1`, as shown in \@ref(fig:fig-shapes).

```{r fig-shapes, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=0.364, fig.align='center'}

shapes <- tibble(
  shape = c(0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6:19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24),
  x = (0:24 %/% 5) / 2,
  y = (-(0:24 %% 5)) / 4
)
ggplot(shapes, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = shape), size = 5, fill = "red") +
  geom_text(aes(label = shape), hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.15) +
  scale_shape_identity() +
  expand_limits(x = 4.1) +
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL, limits = c(-1.2, 0.2)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1/2.75)
```

So far we have discussed aesthetics that we can map or set in a scatterplot, when using a point `geom`. You can learn more about all possible aesthetic mappings in the aesthetic specifications vignette at <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html>.

The specific aesthetics you can use for a plot depend on the `geom` you use to represent the data.

In the next section we dive deeper into `geoms`.

### 2.2.1 Exercises {.unnumbered}

1. Create a scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ` where the points are pink filled in triangles. +2pts

::: {.fold .s .o}
```{r Ans:2.2.1.1}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = displ)) +
  geom_point(color = "pink", shape = "triangle")
```
:::

2. Why did the following code not result in a plot with blue points? +2pts

```{r}

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

::: {.fold .s .o}
**Ans-2.2.1.2:**

```{r}


# Color should be set outside of the aesthetic mapping. 

# If you check what's going inside aes(), you find displ (your x variable), and hwy (your y variable). How does "blue" fit in here? It actually doesn't. 

ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```
:::

This creates a single category called "blue" that gets mapped to a default color (not actually blue).
If there's only one value, it's a fixed aesthetic property, not a data mapping, so it belongs outside aes()!
This is one of the most important ggplot2 concepts to understand. ðŸŽ¯

3. What does the `stroke` aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use `?geom_point`) +2pts

::: {.fold .s .o}
**Ans-2.2.1.3:**

```{r}

# Stroke controls the width of the edge/border for the shapes (21-25)
# that have a fill aesthetic.
 
ggplot(mpg) +  geom_point(
  aes(x = displ, y = hwy),
  shape = 24,
  fill = "purple",
  color = "red",
  stroke = 2,
  size = 8
)
```
:::

4. What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `aes(color = displ < 5)`? Try it by adding color to the following plot: +2pts

```{r}

ggplot(mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```

::: {.fold .s .o}
**Ans-2.2.1.4:**

```{r}

# It creates a logical variable with values `TRUE` and `FALSE` for cars with displacement values below and above 5. 

# Notice color is inside aes() and not outside.

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5)) 
```
:::

**The rule:**

Inside aes() - when color varies by data:
- Different colors for different classes: `aes(color = class)` # Multiple values: "suv", "compact", etc.
- Different colors for different logical values: `aes(color = hwy > 30)` # Two values: TRUE, FALSE  
- Color gradient based on numbers: `aes(color = cty)` # Multiple values: 15, 18, 21, etc.

Outside aes() - when color is constant for all points:
- All points the same color: `geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")`
- All points red: `geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "red")`

## Geometric objects

How are these two plots similar?

```{r echo=FALSE}


p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +  geom_point() 

p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_smooth()

p1 + p2
```

Both plots contain the same x variable, the same y variable, and both describe the same data. But the plots are not identical. Each plot uses a different geometric object, `geom`, to represent the data. The first plot uses the point `geom`, and the plot on the second uses the smooth `geom`, a smooth line fitted to the data.

To change the `geom` in your plot, change the `geom` function that you add to `ggplot()`. For instance, to make the plots above, you can use the following code:

```{r fig.width = 6}
# point
p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point() 

# smooth
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_smooth()

p1 + p2
```

Every `geom` function in ggplot2 takes a `mapping` argument, either defined locally in the `geom` layer or globally in the `ggplot()` layer.

However, not every aesthetic works with every `geom`. You could set the shape of a point, but you couldn't set the "shape" of a line. If you try, ggplot2 will silently ignore that aesthetic mapping. On the other hand, you *could* set the `linetype` of a line.

`geom_smooth()` will draw a different line, with a different `linetype`, for each unique value of the variable that you map to `linetype`.


```{r fig.width = 6, fig.show = 'hold'}

# Top
p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth()

# Bottom
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv)) + 
  geom_smooth()

p1/p2
```

Here, `geom_smooth()` separates the cars into three lines based on their `drv` value, which describes a car's drive train.

One line describes all of the points that have a `4` value, one line describes all of the points that have an `f` value, and one line describes all of the points that have an `r` value.

Here, `4` stands for four-wheel drive, `f` for front-wheel drive, and `r` for rear-wheel drive.

**Notice there is no legend for the first plot because geometric smooth does not have a shape aesthetic.**

If this sounds strange, we can make it clearer by overlaying the lines on top of the raw data and then coloring everything according to `drv`.

```{r fig.width = 6}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv))

```

Notice that this plot contains two `geoms` in the same graph.

You can use the same idea to specify different `data` for each layer.
Here, we use red points as well as open circles to highlight two-seater cars.
The local data argument in `geom_point()` overrides the global data argument in `ggplot()` for that layer only.

```{r}

g <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = mpg %>% filter(class == '2seater'),
             color = "red")

g + geom_point(
  data = mpg %>% filter(class == '2seater'),
  shape = "circle open",
  size = 3,
  color = "red"
)
```

`geoms` are the fundamental building blocks of `ggplot2`. You can completely transform the look of your plot by changing its geom, and different `geoms` can reveal different features of your data. For example, the histogram and density plot below reveal that the distribution of highway mileage is bimodal and right skewed while the boxplot reveals two potential outliers.

```{r fig.width = 6}
 
# histogram
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)

# density
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + geom_density()

# boxplot
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy)) + geom_boxplot()
```

`ggplot2` provides more than 40 `geoms` but these don't cover all possible plots one could make. If you need a different `geom`, we recommend looking into extension packages first to see if someone else has already implemented it (see <https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/> for a sampling).

For example, the **ggridges** package ([https://wilkelab.org/ggridges](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/){.uri}) is useful for making ridgeline plots, which can be useful for visualizing the density of a numerical variable for different levels of a categorical variable.

In the following plot not only did we use a new `geom` (`geom_density_ridges()`), but we have also mapped the same variable to multiple aesthetics (`drv` to `y`, `fill`, and `color`) as well as set an aesthetic (`alpha = 0.5`) to make the density curves transparent.

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
library(ggridges)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, y = drv, fill = drv, color = drv)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE)
```

The best place to get a comprehensive overview of all of the `geoms` `ggplot2` offers, as well as all functions in the package, is the reference page: <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference>.
To learn more about any single `geom`, use the help (e.g., `?geom_smooth`).

### 2.3.1 Exercises {.unnumbered}

p + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("boxplot")
p + geom_point() + ggtitle("point")
p + geom_area() + ggtitle("area")
```
:::

2. Earlier in this chapter we used `show.legend` without explaining it:

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = drv), show.legend = FALSE)
```

What does `show.legend = FALSE` do here? What happens if you remove it? Try it. +2pts


::: {.fold .s .o}
**Ans-2.3.1.2:**

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.align = "center"}
# It removes the legend for the `geom` it's specified in, in this case it removes the legend for the smooth lines that are colored based on `drv`.

# If you remove `show.legend`, it will show the legend as the default is show.legend = T.

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = drv))
```
:::

3. What does the `se` argument to `geom_smooth()` do? +2pts

library(xfun)
raw_string(str_wrap('It displays the confidence interval around the smooth line.\n You can remove this with `se = FALSE`.'))
```

4. Recreate the R code necessary to generate and save the following graph \@ref(fig:6-plots) and arrange them in a figure with 2 columns. Note that wherever a categorical variable is used in the plot, it's `drv`. Use the mathematical notation in one, and the function from `patchwork`, `plot_layout` in another for laying out the plot. +6pts

```{r 6-plots, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = 'Six plots arranged in two columns'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/6-plots.png")

# OR

library(patchwork)
p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6 +
  plot_layout(ncol = 2)

```
:::

**Notice the plots don't line up as nicely if you don't use the `plot_layout` function from patchwork because of the figure legends.**

## Facets

Another way, which is particularly useful for categorical variables, is
to split your plot into **facets**, subplots that each display one
subset of the data.

To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`. The first
argument of `facet_wrap()` is a formula, which you create with `~`
followed by a variable name. The variable that you pass to
`facet_wrap()` should be categorical.

Here "formula" is the name of the thing created by `~`, not a synonym
for "equation".
```{r fig.width = 7}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~cyl)
```


To facet your plot with the combination of two variables, switch from
`facet_wrap()` to `facet_grid()`. The first argument of `facet_grid()`
is also a formula, but now it's a double sided formula: `rows ~ cols`.

```{r fig.width = 6}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

The first argument in `facet_grid` determines the faceting by row, the second by column.
By default each of the facets share the same scale and range for x and y axes.

This is useful when you want to compare data across facets but it can be limiting when you want to visualize the relationship within each facet better.

Setting the `scales` argument in a faceting function to `"free"` will allow for different axis scales across both rows and columns, `"free_x"` will allow for different scales across rows, and `"free_y"` will allow for different scales across columns.

```{r fig.width = 6}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, scales = "free_y")
```

Modifying facet label appearance:

```{r fig.width = 5}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) +
  theme(
    strip.text.x = element_text(
      size = 12,
      face = "bold",
      colour = "blue",
      angle = 75
    ),
    strip.text.y = element_text(
      size = 14,
      face = "bold",
      colour = "red"
    ),
    strip.background = element_rect(
      colour = "navy",
      fill = "#CCCCFF",
      linewidth  = 2
    )
  )
```

## Statistical transformations

Consider a basic bar chart, drawn with `geom_bar()` or `geom_col()`. The
following chart displays the total number of diamonds in the `diamonds`
dataset, grouped by `cut`. The `diamonds` dataset is in the `ggplot2`
package and contains information on \~54,000 diamonds, including the
`price`, `carat`, `color`, `clarity`, and `cut` of each diamond. The
chart shows that more diamonds are available with high quality cuts than
with low quality cuts.

```{r fig.width = 6}

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) + 
  geom_bar()
```


On the x-axis, the chart displays `cut`, a variable from `diamonds`. On
the y-axis, it displays count, but count is not a variable in
`diamonds`! Where does count come from? Many graphs, like scatterplots,
plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts,
calculate new values to plot:

-   Bar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and
    then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.

-   Smoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from
    the model.

-   Boxplots compute the five-number summary of the distribution and
    then display that summary as a specially formatted box.

The algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a
**stat**, short for statistical transformation.

The following figure shows how this process works with `geom_bar()`. When creating a bar chart we first start with the raw data, then aggregate it to count the number of observations in each bar, and finally map those computed variables to plot aesthetics:
```{r fig-vis-stat-bar, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-stat-bar.png")
```

You can learn which stat a `geom` uses by inspecting the default value for
the `stat` argument. For example, `?geom_bar` shows that the default
value for `stat` is "count", which means that `geom_bar()` uses
`stat_count()`. `stat_count()` is documented on the same page as
`geom_bar()`. If you scroll down, the section called "Computed
variables" explains that it computes two new variables: `count` and
`prop`.

Every `geom` has a default stat; and every stat has a default `geom`. This
means that you can typically use `geoms` without worrying about the
underlying statistical transformation. However, there are three reasons
why you might need to use a stat explicitly:

1. You might want to override the default stat. In the code below, we
    change the stat of `geom_bar()` from count (the default) to
    identity.This lets us map the height of the bars to the raw values
    of a y variable. Here, we use `stat = "identity"` to plot the raw because we want to plot the raw values of the y variable, not the count of the y variable.

```{r fig.width = 6}

diamonds %>%
  count(cut) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cut, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

2. You might want to override the default `mapping` from transformed variables to aesthetics. For example, you might want to display a bar chart of proportions, rather than counts:

```{r fig.width = 5}

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +
  geom_bar()
```
The prop variable is a computed value provided by the stat = "count" transformation (the default for `geom_bar`).

To find the possible variables that can be computed by the stat, look for the section titled "computed variables" in the help for `geom_bar()`.

`ggplot2` provides more than 20 stats for you to use.
Each stat is a function, so you can get help in the usual way, e.g., `?stat_bin`.

'geom_col' is the same as geom_bar(stat = 'identity'), so if your data contains groups x and the count for each group y, you can just use this function instead.

  geom_bar() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
```
:::

## Position adjustments

There's one more piece of magic associated with bar charts.
You can color a bar chart using either the `color` aesthetic, or, more usefully, the `fill` aesthetic:

```{r fig.width = 5}
# Top
p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, color = drv)) + 
  geom_bar()

# Bottom
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_bar()

p1/p2
```

Note what happens if you map the fill aesthetic to another variable, like `class`: the bars are automatically stacked.
Each colored rectangle represents a combination of `drv` and `class`.

```{r fig.width = 5}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

The stacking is performed automatically using the **position adjustment** specified by the `position` argument.
If you don't want a stacked bar chart, you can use one of three other options: `"identity"`, `"dodge"` or `"fill"`.

The identity position adjustment is more useful for 2d `geoms`, like points, where it is the default.

-   `position = "fill"` works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height.
    This makes it easier to compare proportions across groups.

-   `position = "dodge"` places overlapping objects directly *beside* one another.
    This makes it easier to compare individual values.

```{r fig.width = 5}


p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + ggtitle("Position = fill")


p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, fill = class)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + ggtitle("Position = dodge")

p1/p2
```

There's one other type of adjustment that's not useful for bar charts,
but can be very useful for scatterplots. Recall our first scatterplot.
Did you notice that the plot displays only 126 points, even though there
are 234 observations in the dataset?

```{r fig.width = 5, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

The underlying values of `hwy` and `displ` are rounded so the points
appear on a grid and many points overlap each other. This problem is
known as **overplotting**. This arrangement makes it difficult to see
the distribution of the data. Are the data points spread equally
throughout the graph, or is there one special combination of `hwy` and
`displ` that contains 109 values?

You can avoid this gridding by setting the position adjustment to
"jitter". `position = "jitter"` adds a small amount of random noise to
each point. This spreads the points out because no two points are likely
to receive the same amount of random noise.

```{r fig.width = 5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
```

Adding randomness seems like a strange way to improve your plot, but while it makes your graph less accurate at small scales, it makes your graph *more* revealing at large scales.
Because this is such a useful operation, `ggplot2` comes with a shorthand for `geom_point(position = "jitter")`: `geom_jitter()`.

To learn more about a position adjustment, look up the help page associated with each adjustment: `?position_dodge`, `?position_fill`, `?position_identity`, `?position_jitter`, and `?position_stack`.

## Grammar of graphics

We can expand on the graphing template you've learned by adding position adjustments, stats, coordinate systems, and faceting:

```         
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

Our new template takes seven parameters, the bracketed words that appear
in the template. In practice, you rarely need to supply all seven
parameters to make a graph because `ggplot2` will provide useful defaults
for everything except the data, the mappings, and the `geom` function.

The seven parameters in the template compose the grammar of graphics, a
formal system for building plots. The grammar of graphics is based on
the insight that you can uniquely describe *any* plot as a combination
of a dataset, a `geom`, a set of mappings, a stat, a position adjustment,
a coordinate system, a faceting scheme, and a theme.

To see how this works, consider how you could build a basic plot from
scratch: you could start with a dataset and then transform it into the
information that you want to display (with a stat). Next, you could
choose a geometric object to represent each observation in the
transformed data. You could then use the aesthetic properties of the
`geoms` to represent variables in the data. You would map the values of
each variable to the levels of an aesthetic. These steps are illustrated
in \@ref(fig:visualization-grammar). You'd then select a coordinate
system to place the `geoms` into, using the location of the objects (which
is itself an aesthetic property) to display the values of the x and y
variables.

```{r visualization-grammar, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-grammar.png")
```

At this point, you would have a complete graph, but you could further adjust the positions of the `geoms` within the coordinate system (a position adjustment) or split the graph into subplots (faceting).
You could also extend the plot by adding one or more additional layers, where each additional layer uses a dataset, a `geom`, a set of mappings, a stat, and a position adjustment.

You could use this method to build *any* plot that you imagine.
In other words, you can use the code template that you've learned in this chapter to build hundreds of thousands of unique plots.

If you'd like to learn more about the theoretical underpinnings of `ggplot2`, you might enjoy reading "[The Layered Grammar of Graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf)", the scientific paper that describes the theory of `ggplot2` in detail.

## Summary

In this chapter you learned about the layered grammar of graphics starting with aesthetics and geometries to build a simple plot, facets for splitting the plot into subsets, statistics for understanding how `geoms` are calculated, position adjustments for controlling the fine details of position when `geoms` might otherwise overlap, and coordinate systems which allow you to fundamentally change what `x` and `y` mean.

Two very useful resources for getting an overview of the complete `ggplot2` functionality are the `ggplot2` cheatsheet (which you can find at <https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets>) and the `ggplot2`

## Introduction

For publishing purposes, you need to *communicate* your understanding to others. Your audience will likely not share your background knowledge and will not be deeply invested in the data. To help others quickly build up a good mental model of the data, you will need to invest considerable effort in making your plots as self-explanatory as possible. In this chapter, you'll learn some of the tools that `ggplot2` provides to do so.

This chapter focuses on the tools you need to create good graphics. We assume that you know what you want, and just need to know how to do it. For that reason, we highly recommend pairing this chapter with a good general visualization book.

We particularly like [The Truthful Art](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321934075/), by Albert Cairo. It doesn't teach the mechanics of creating visualizations, but instead focuses on what you need to think about in order to create effective graphics.

### Prerequisites

In this chapter, we'll focus once again on `ggplot2`. We'll also use a little **dplyr** for data manipulation, **scales** to override the default breaks, labels, transformations and palettes, and a few `ggplot2` extension packages, including **ggrepel** ([https://ggrepel.slowkow.com](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/)) by Kamil Slowikowski and **patchwork** ([https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)) by Thomas Lin Pedersen.

First install the packages `patchwork`, `ggthemes` and `scales` if you haven't already done so by uncommenting this code:

```{r}
# install.packages(c("patchwork","scales","ggthemes"))
```


```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(ggrepel)
library(patchwork)
library(ggthemes)
```

## Labels

The easiest place to start when turning an exploratory graphic into an expository graphic is with good labels. You add labels with the `labs()` function, it's a little bit easier to use than `theme()` because it's designed to work with the `aes()` function.

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    x = "Engine displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway fuel economy (mpg)",
    color = "Car type",
    title = "Fuel efficiency generally decreases with engine size",
    subtitle = "Two seaters (sports cars) are an exception because 
    of their light weight",
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov"
  )
```

The purpose of a plot title is to summarize the main finding.
Avoid titles that just describe what the plot is, e.g., "A scatterplot of engine displacement vs. fuel economy".

If you need to add more text, there are two other useful labels: `subtitle` adds additional detail in a smaller font beneath the title and `caption` adds text at the bottom right of the plot, often used to describe the source of the data.

You can also use `labs()` to replace the axis and legend titles. Note the replacement of the legend title by "Car type" in the previous plot. It's usually a good idea to replace short variable names with more detailed descriptions, and to include the units.

It's possible to use mathematical equations instead of text strings.
Just switch `""` out for `quote()` and read about the available options in `?plotmath`:

```{r, fig.asp = 1, out.width = "50%", fig.width = 3}


df <- tibble(x = 1:10,
             y = cumsum(x ^ 2))

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = quote(x[i]),
       y = quote(sum(x[i] ^ 2, i == 1, n)))
```

## Annotations

In addition to labeling major components of your plot, it's often useful to label individual observations or groups of observations. The first tool you have at your disposal is `geom_text()`. `geom_text()` is similar to `geom_point()`, but it has an additional aesthetic: `label`. This makes it possible to add textual labels to your plots.

There are two possible sources of labels. First, you might have a tibble that provides labels. In the following plot we pull out the cars with the highest engine size in each drive type and save their information as a new data frame called `label_info`.

`slice_head()` is a useful function from the **dplyr** package that allows you to select the first `n` rows of a data frame so when n = 1 it means the right-most point for each drive type.

`case_when()` is a function that allows you to specify multiple conditions and their corresponding values in a single line of code. It's a more readable and concise way to write multiple `if_else()` statements.

```{r}

label_info <- mpg |>
  group_by(drv) |>
  arrange(desc(displ)) |>
  slice_head(n = 1) |>
  mutate(
    drive_type = case_when(
      drv == "f" ~ "front-wheel drive",
      drv == "r" ~ "rear-wheel drive",
      drv == "4" ~ "4-wheel drive"
    )
  ) |> select(displ, hwy, drv, drive_type)

label_info
```
**Notice that `displ` values in `label_info` have captured the right-most point for each drive type.**

Then, we use this new data frame to directly label the three groups to replace the legend with labels placed directly on the plot. Using the `fontface` and `size` arguments we can customize the look of the text labels.

They're larger than the rest of the text on the plot and bolded.
(`theme(legend.position = "none"`) turns all the legends off --- we'll talk about it more shortly.)

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_text(
    data = label_info,
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy, label = drive_type),
    fontface = "bold",
    size = 5,
    hjust = "right",
    vjust = "bottom"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
**Once you see the placement you can use `nudge_x` and `nudge_y` to set it so that it doesn't overlap.**

Note the use of `hjust` (horizontal justification) and `vjust` (vertical justification) to control the alignment of the label.

However the annotated plot we made above is hard to read because the labels overlap with each other, and with the points.

We can use the `geom_label_repel()` function from the ggrepel package to address both of these issues. This useful package will automatically adjust labels so that they don't overlap:

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  geom_label_repel(
    data = label_info,
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy, label = drive_type),
    fontface = "bold",
    size = 5,
    nudge_y = 2
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

You can also use the same idea to highlight certain points on a plot with `geom_text_repel()` from the ggrepel package.
Note another handy technique used here: we added a second layer of large, hollow points to further highlight the labelled points.

```{r}

potential_outliers <- mpg |>
  filter(hwy > 40 | (hwy > 20 & displ > 5))
  
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(data = potential_outliers, aes(label = model)) +
  geom_point(data = potential_outliers, color = "red") +
  geom_point(
    data = potential_outliers,
    color = "red", size = 3, shape = "circle open"
  )
```

Remember, in addition to `geom_text()` and `geom_label()`, you have many other `geoms` in `ggplot2` available to help annotate your plot.
A couple ideas:

-   Use `geom_hline()` and `geom_vline()` to add reference lines.
    We often make them thick (`linewidth = 2`) and white (`color = white`), and draw them underneath the primary data layer.
    That makes them easy to see, without drawing attention away from the data.

-   Use `geom_rect()` to draw a rectangle around points of interest.
    The boundaries of the rectangle are defined by aesthetics `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, `ymax`.
    
-   Use `geom_segment()` with the `arrow` argument to draw attention to a point with an arrow.
    Use aesthetics `x` and `y` to define the starting location, and `xend` and `yend` to define the end location.

Another handy function for adding annotations to plots is `annotate()`.
As a rule of thumb, `geoms` are generally useful for highlighting a subset of the data while `annotate()` is useful for adding one or few annotation elements to a plot.

To demonstrate using `annotate()`, let's create some text to add to our plot.
The text is a bit long, so we'll use `stringr::str_wrap()` to automatically add line breaks to it given the number of characters you want per line:

```{r}
trend_text <- "Larger engine sizes tend to have lower fuel economy." |> 
  str_wrap(width = 30)

trend_text
```

Then, we add two layers of annotation: one with a label `geom` and the other with a segment geom.
The `x` and `y` aesthetics in both define where the annotation should start, and the `xend` and `yend` aesthetics in the segment annotation define the end location of the segment.

Note also that the segment is styled as an arrow.

`annotate` is a very flexible function that can be used to add a wide variety of annotations to your plots. You can add text, points, lines, and more.

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  annotate(
    geom = "label",  
    x = 3.5,
    y = 38,
    label = trend_text, # the text to display
    hjust = "left",
    color = "red"
  ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "segment",
    x = 3, # start of the line
    y = 35,
    xend = 5, # end of the line
    yend = 25,
    color = "red",
    arrow = arrow(type = "closed") # add an arrow head
  )


```

Annotation is a powerful tool for communicating main takeaways and interesting features of your visualizations.
The only limit is your imagination (and your patience with positioning annotations to be aesthetically pleasing)!

  )

## Scales

The third way you can make your plot better for communication is to adjust the scales.

Scales control how the aesthetic mappings manifest visually.

### Default scales

Normally, `ggplot2` automatically adds scales for you.

For example, when you type:

```{r default-scales, results='hide', fig.show = 'hide'}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))
```

`ggplot2` automatically adds default scales behind the scenes:

```{r, fig.show='hide'}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  scale_color_discrete()
```

Note the naming scheme for scales: `scale_` followed by the name of the aesthetic, then `_`, then the name of the scale.
The default scales are named according to the type of variable they align with: continuous, discrete, datetime, or date.
`scale_x_continuous()` puts the numeric values from `displ` on a continuous number line on the x-axis, `scale_color_discrete()` chooses colors for each of the `class` of car, etc.

There are lots of non-default scales which you'll learn about below.

The default scales have been carefully chosen to do a good job for a wide range of inputs.
Nevertheless, you might want to override the defaults for two reasons:

-   You might want to tweak some of the parameters of the default scale.
    This allows you to do things like change the breaks on the axes, or the key labels on the legend.

-   You might want to replace the scale altogether, and use a completely different algorithm.
    Often you can do better than the default because you know more about the data.

### Axis ticks and legend keys

Collectively axes and legends are called **guides**.
Axes are used for x and y aesthetics; legends are used for everything else.

There are two primary arguments that affect the appearance of the ticks on the axes and the keys on the legend: `breaks` and `labels`.
Breaks controls the position of the ticks, or the values associated with the keys.
Labels controls the text label associated with each tick/key.
The most common use of `breaks` is to override the default choice:

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 40, by = 5)) 
```

You can use `labels` in the same way (a character vector the same length as `breaks`), but you can also set it to `NULL` to suppress the labels altogether. This can be useful for maps, or for publishing plots where you can't share the absolute numbers.

You can also use `breaks` and `labels` to control the appearance of legends. For discrete scales for categorical variables, `labels` can be a named list of the existing levels names and the desired labels for them.

`scale_color_discrete()` is a discrete scale for color, and `scale_color_manual()` is a manual scale for color.


```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL) +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("4" = "4-wheel", "f" = "front", "r" = "rear"))
```

The `labels` argument coupled with labeling functions from the scales package is also useful for formatting numbers as currency, percent, etc.

The following example shows two box plots of price versus cut of diamonds.

The plot on the left shows default labeling with `label_dollar()` from the `scales` package, which adds a dollar sign as well as a thousand separator comma.

The plot on the right adds further customization by dividing dollar values by 1,000 and adding a suffix "K" (for "thousands") as well as adding custom breaks.
Note that `breaks` is in the original scale of the data.

```{r, fig.width = 4}

# Left-# Right
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.05) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) + ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.05) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = label_dollar(scale = 1 / 1000, suffix = "K"),
    breaks = seq(1000, 19000, by = 6000)
  )
```

Another handy label function is `label_percent()`:

```{r, out.width="80%"}

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Percentage", labels = label_percent())
```


### Legend layout

You will most often use `breaks` and `labels` to tweak the axes.
While they both also work for legends, there are a few other techniques you are more likely to use.

To control the overall position of the legend, you need to use a `theme()` setting.
We'll come back to themes at the end of the chapter, but in brief, they control the non-data parts of the plot.

The theme setting `legend.position` controls where the legend is drawn:

```{r, out.width="80%", fig.width = 10, fig.asp = 0.5}

base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class))

# the default  right, then left
p1 <- base + theme(legend.position = "right") 

p2 <- base + theme(legend.position = "left")

# then top, then bottom
p3 <- base +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 3)) 

p4 <- base +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 3))

p1 + p2 + p3 + p4
```

If your plot is short and wide, place the legend at the top or bottom, and if it's tall and narrow, place the legend at the left or right.
You can also use `legend.position = "none"` to suppress the display of the legend altogether.

To control the display of individual legends, use `guides()` along with `guide_legend()` or `guide_colorbar()`.

`guides()` is used to control the appearance of the legend.

`guide_legend()` is used for discrete scales, and `guide_colorbar()` is used for continuous scales.

`guide_legend()` has a number of arguments that allow you to control the appearance of the legend.

The following example shows two important settings: controlling the number of rows the legend uses with `nrow`, and overriding one of the aesthetics to make the points bigger.

This is particularly useful if you have used a low `alpha` to display many points on a plot.
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 2, override.aes = list(size = 4)))
```

Note that the name of the argument in `guides()` matches the name of the aesthetic, just like in `labs()`.

### Replacing a scale

Instead of just tweaking the details a little, you can instead replace the scale altogether.
There are two types of scales you're mostly likely to want to switch out: continuous position scales and color scales.

Fortunately, the same principles apply to all the other aesthetics, so once you've mastered position and color, you'll be able to quickly pick up other scale replacements.

### Replacing a scale

Another scale that is frequently customized is color.

The default categorical scale picks colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.

Useful alternatives are the RColorBrewer scales which have been hand tuned to work better for people with common types of color blindness.

The two plots below look similar, but there is enough difference in the shades of red and green that the dots on the right can be distinguished even by people with red-green color blindness.[^communication-1]

[^communication-1]: You can use a tool like [SimDaltonism](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/) to simulate color blindness to test these images.
```{r, fig.width = 8}

# default color palette
p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) 

# RColorBrewer palette
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point(aes(color = drv)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")

p1 + p2
```

Don't forget simpler techniques for improving accessibility.

If there are just a few colors, you can add a redundant shape mapping.

This will also help ensure your plot is interpretable in black and white.

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv, shape = drv)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```

The ColorBrewer scales are documented online at <https://colorbrewer2.org/> and made available in R via the **RColorBrewer** package, by Erich Neuwirth.
\@ref(fig:fig-brewer) shows the complete list of all palettes.

The sequential (top) and diverging (bottom) palettes are particularly useful if your categorical values are ordered, or have a "middle".
This often arises if you've used `cut()` to make a continuous variable into a categorical variable.

```{r fig-brewer, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'All colorBrewer scales.', fig.asp = 2.5}

par(mar = c(0, 3, 0, 0))
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()
```

When you have a predefined mapping between values and colors, use `scale_color_manual()`.

For example, if we map presidential party to color, we want to use the standard mapping of red for Republicans and blue for Democrats.

One approach for assigning these colors is using hex color codes:

```{r}

presidential |> mutate(id = 33 + row_number()) |> # `row_number()` is a function that returns the row number of a data frame
  ggplot(aes(x = start, y = id, color = party)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = end, yend = id)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(Republican = "#E81B23", Democratic = "#00AEF3"))
```

For continuous color, you can use the built-in `scale_color_gradient()` or `scale_fill_gradient()`.

If you have a diverging scale, you can use `scale_color_gradient2()`.

That allows you to give, for example, positive and negative values different colors. That's sometimes also useful if you want to distinguish points above or below the mean.

### Zooming

There are three ways to control the plot limits:

1. Adjusting what data are plotted.
2. Setting the limits in each scale.
3. Setting `xlim` and `ylim` in `coord_cartesian()`.

We'll demonstrate these options in a series of plots. The plot on the left shows the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency, colored by type of drive train. The plot on the right shows the same variables, but subsets the data that are plotted. Subsetting the data has affected the x and y scales as well as the smooth curve.

1. Adjusting what data are plotted:
```{r, fig.width = 8}

# All data vs. subsetted data
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth() + mpg |>
  filter(displ >= 5 & displ <= 6 & hwy >= 10 & hwy <= 25) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

Let's compare these to the two plots below where the plot on the left sets the `limits` on individual scales and the plot on the right sets them in `coord_cartesian()`.

`coord_cartesian()` is generally more useful if you want to zoom in on a region of the plot.

We can see that reducing the limits is equivalent to subsetting the data.
Therefore, to zoom in on a region of the plot, it's generally best to use `coord_cartesian()`. because it doesn't change the fitting of `geom_smooth`.

2. Setting the limits in each scale (left).
3.  Setting `xlim` and `ylim` in `coord_cartesian()` (right).
```{r, fig.width = 8}


# Limiting scale (equivalent to subsetting) vs. zooming in on data
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(5, 6)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(10, 25)) + ggplot(mpg, 
    aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(5, 6), ylim = c(10, 25))
```

On the other hand, setting the `limits` on individual scales is generally more useful if you want to *expand* the limits, e.g., to match scales across different plots.

For example, if we extract two classes of cars and plot them separately, it's difficult to compare the plots because all three scales (the x-axis, the y-axis, and the color aesthetic) have different ranges.

```{r}

suv <- mpg |> filter(class == "suv")
compact <- mpg |> filter(class == "compact")

# suv vs compact
ggplot(suv, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() + ggplot(compact, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +  
  geom_point()
```

One way to overcome this problem is to share scales across multiple plots, training the scales with the `limits` of the full data.

```{r}

x_scale <- scale_x_continuous(limits = range(mpg$displ))
y_scale <- scale_y_continuous(limits = range(mpg$hwy))
col_scale <- scale_color_discrete(limits = unique(mpg$drv))

# suv vs. compact on the same scale
ggplot(suv, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  x_scale +
  y_scale +
  col_scale + ggplot(compact, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  x_scale +
  y_scale +
  col_scale
```

In this particular case, you could have simply used faceting, but this technique is useful more generally, if for instance, you want to spread plots over multiple pages of a report.

1. Why doesn't the following code override the default scale? Fix the plot so that it colors the points with a gradient set by `low = "yellow", high = "red"`. +2pts

```{r, fig.show = 'hide'}

df <- tibble(x = rnorm(10000),
             y = rnorm(10000))

ggplot(df) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = x)) +

```
<div class="fold s o">

**Ans-1.4.1.1:**
```{r Ans-1.4.1.1}

# It does not override the default scale because the colors for the default point `shape = 19` ("filled circle") in `geom_point()` are set by the `color` aesthetic, not the `fill` aesthetic.

3. First, create the following plot. Then, modify the code using `override.aes` to make the legend easier to see. +2pts
```{r, results='hide', fig.show = 'hide'}

<div class="fold s o">
**Ans-1.4.1.3:**
```{r Ans-1.4.1.3}

# The problem with the legend is that the `alpha` value make the colors hard to see. So I'll override the alpha value to make the points solid in the legend.

ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = cut), alpha = 1 / 20) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(nrow = 1, override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))
```
</div>

## Themes {#sec-themes}

Finally, you can customize the non-data elements of your plot with a theme:

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_classic()
```

`ggplot2` includes the eight themes shown in \@ref(fig:fig-themes), with `theme_gray()` as the default.[^communication-2]

Many more are included in add-on packages like **ggthemes** (<https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes>), by Jeffrey Arnold.

You can also create your own themes, if you are trying to match a particular corporate or journal style.

Many people wonder why the default theme has a gray background. This was a deliberate choice because it puts the data forward while still making the grid lines visible. The white grid lines are visible (which is important because they significantly aid position judgments), but they have little visual impact and we can easily tune them out. The gray background gives the plot a similar typographic color to the text, ensuring that the graphics fit in with the flow of a document without jumping out with a bright white background. Finally, the gray background creates a continuous field of color which ensures that the plot is perceived as a single visual entity.

You can also set default theme to have a white background by using: 

Setting ggplot2 theme
`ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw())`

```{r fig-themes, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'The eight themes built-in to `ggplot2`.'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/visualization-themes.png")
```

It's also possible to control individual components of each theme, like the size and color of the font used for the y axis.

We've already seen that `legend.position` controls where the legend is drawn.

There are many other aspects of the legend that can be customized with `theme()`.

For example, in the plot below we change the direction of the legend as well as put a black border around it.

Note that customization of the legend box and plot title elements of the theme are done with `element_*()` functions.

These functions specify the styling of non-data components, e.g., the title text is bolded in the `face` argument of `element_text()` and the legend border color is defined in the `color` argument of `element_rect()`.

The theme elements that control the position of the title and the caption are `plot.title.position` and `plot.caption.position`, respectively.

In the following plot these are set to `"plot"` to indicate these elements are aligned to the entire plot area, instead of the plot panel (the default).

A few other helpful `theme()` components are used to change the placement for format of the title and caption text (this is more what we are used to).

```{r}

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Larger engine sizes tend to have lower fuel economy",
    caption = "Source: https://fueleconomy.gov."
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(0.6, 0.7),
    legend.direction = "horizontal",
    legend.box.background = element_rect(color = "black"),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    plot.caption.position = "plot",
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)
  )
```

For an overview of all `theme()` components, see help with `?theme`.

The [ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/) is also a great place to go for the full details on theming.

```

## Layout

So far we talked about how to create and modify a single plot.

What if you have multiple plots you want to lay out in a certain way?

The patchwork package allows you to combine separate plots into the same graphic.

We loaded this package earlier in the chapter.

To place two plots next to each other, you can simply add them to each other.

Note that you first need to create the plots and save them as objects (in the following example they're called `p1` and `p2`).

Then, you place them next to each other with `+`.

```{r, fig.asp = 0.5}

p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Plot 1")
p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Plot 2")

p1 + p2
```

You can also create complex plot layouts using `|` and `/`. In the following, `|` places the `p1` and `p3` next to each other and `/` moves `p2` to the next line.

```{r, fig.asp = 0.8}

p3 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Plot 3")

(p1 | p3) / p2
```

Additionally, patchwork allows you to collect legends from multiple plots into one common legend, customize the placement of the legend as well as dimensions of the plots, and add a common title, subtitle, caption, etc. to your plots.

Below we create 5 plots:

We have turned off the legends on the box plots and the scatterplot and collected the legends for the density plots at the top of the plot with `& theme(legend.position = "top")`.

Note the use of the `&` operator here instead of the usual `+`.

This is because we're modifying the theme for the patchwork plot as opposed to the individual ggplots.

The legend is placed on top, inside the `guide_area()`.

Finally, we have also customized the heights of the various components of our patchwork -- the guide has a height of 1, the box plots 3, density plots 2, and the faceted scatterplot 4.

Patchwork divides up the area you have allotted for your plot using this scale and places the components accordingly.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.asp = 1}

p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = cty, color = drv)) + 
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Plot 1")

p2 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Plot 2")

p3 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, color = drv, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Plot 3")

p4 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, color = drv, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Plot 4")

p5 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~drv) +
  labs(title = "Plot 5")

(
  guide_area() / (p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4) / p5
) +
  plot_annotation(
    title = "City and highway mileage for cars with different drive trains",
    caption = "Source: https://fueleconomy.gov."
  ) +
  plot_layout(
    guides = "collect",
    heights = c(1, 3, 2, 4)
  ) &
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

```{r Ans-1.6.1.1}

# It plots the first plot in the left half of the plot window and the second and third plots in the right half of the plot window; top and bottom.
# This happens because the `/` takes precedence over the `+` or `|` statements, like they do in mathematics: 3 + 4/5 vs. (3 + 4)/5

p1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +

## Summary

In this chapter you've learned about adding plot labels such as title, subtitle, caption as well as modifying default axis labels, using annotation to add informational text to your plot or to highlight specific data points, customizing the axis scales, and changing the theme of your plot.
You've also learned about combining multiple plots in a single graph using both simple and complex plot layouts.

While you've so far learned about how to make many different types of plots and how to customize them using a variety of techniques, we've barely scratched the surface of what you can create with `ggplot2`.

If you want to get a comprehensive understanding of `ggplot2`, we recommend reading the book, [*ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*](https://ggplot2-book.org).

Other useful resources are the [*R Graphics Cookbook*](https://r-graphics.org) by Winston Chang and [*Fundamentals of Data Visualization*](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) by Claus Wilke.
